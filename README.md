This is currently work in progress. I have made an app that is kinda stupid and has serious security flaws
I am currently restucturing the database design and the password saving system so that the User has 1 master password to remember for the WHOLE app.
He could add extra passwords for the individual vaults. I will make it look better and less cluttered and I will make a full simple encryption library,
to match. The old module is crap. Wish me luck.
